<p>We are an agency that promotes health education among children, focusing specifically on primary and secondary school children. We carry out activities, provide sponsorship for events, check-ups, and various workshops in the field of health, alongside our cause of trying to improve the admittedly low level of importance that health education gets in schools around the country. We also conduct inter-school competitions to increase awareness about health, disease and medicine. 
</p>
<p>We began as a small team of three people in 1975, a part of the generation that still had people denying the effectiveness of vaccines. We believed that children, and their parents, especially those from less privileged backgrounds, deserved chances at living long and healthy lives, and that unless they were taught about good and healthy habits and basic sanitation, they would not be able to get those chances.
